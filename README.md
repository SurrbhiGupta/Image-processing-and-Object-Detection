- numpy, opencv, matplotlib, pandas, and canny edge detection method, these methods and libraries has been used in this project.
opencv python file which contains use of opencv library in image processing like resizing, edge detection, smoothening, and other basic methods.
opencv file is compatible with google collab as cv2_imshow() operation is imported from google collab.
openCV file contain some basic idea of opencv library  or it is a small part of opencv file.
Numpy python file is all about numpy basic operations.
- count_and_area_of_object.ipynb file cantains a model which can claculate the number of object in the image and find their labels. other model in it can calculate the area of the object in an image.
- porosity.ipynb file contains two model which can calculate the porosity of a material by it's image. first model, where noise is reduced by using Gaussian blur and by chnaging the value of threshold and kernel size we can find the porosity with good accuracy. The sencond model, here morphological operation is applied to reduce the noise from the image, by changing the value of threshold and kernel size we can achieve good accuracy.
